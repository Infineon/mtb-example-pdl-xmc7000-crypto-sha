# PDL Cryptography: SHA demonstration

This code example shows how to generate a 32-byte hash value or message digest for an arbitrary user input message with the SHA-2 algorithm using the Cryptographic hardware block in the MCU. The example further shows that any change in the message results in a unique hash value for the message. The hash value generated for the message is displayed on a UART terminal emulator.

## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b.	Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-pdl-xmc7000-crypto-sha](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pdl-xmc7000-crypto-sha)" application with the desired name "Cryptography_SHA_Demonstration" configured for the *KIT_XMC72_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC72_EVK --app-id mtb-example-pdl-xmc7000-crypto-sha --user-app-name Cryptography_SHA_Demonstration --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```
The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. Press the reset button on the kit and enter the message for which the hash value or message digest should be generated. The generated hash value is printed on the UART terminal. Note that the SHA operation generates a unique hash value for every input message.

For example, the message "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", which uses every letter in the English alphabets, has a message digest value completely different from the message digest value for the message “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy Dog” even though the variation is minor (‘D’ instead of ‘d’).

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the debugging CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

Secure hash algorithm (SHA) is a function that takes a message of arbitrary length and reduces it to a fixed length residue or message digest, after performing a series of mathematically defined operations that practically guarantee that any change in the message will change the hash value. A hash value is used for message authentication by transmitting a message with a hash value appended to it and recalculating the message hash value using the same algorithm at the recipient’s end. If the hashes differ, it indicates that the message has been corrupted.

In this example, the user input message is read from the UART terminal. A 32-byte long hash value is generated using the SHA-2 algorithm. For any arbitrary message, a 32-byte hash value is generated. The 32-byte hash value for the user input message is then displayed on the UART terminal emulator. Note that the maximum message size is restricted to 100 characters in this example. If you need to increase the message size, change the `MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE` macro in the *main.c* to the message size you require.
